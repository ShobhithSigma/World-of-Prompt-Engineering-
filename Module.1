# ðŸ“Œ Prompt Engineering: The Complete Guide

Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering** GitHub repository! 
This project aims to provide a structured, practical, and insightful approach to understanding and mastering prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4.

---

## ðŸ§  1. Definition

**Prompt Engineering** is the art and science of designing effective inputs (prompts) to communicate with LLMs. 
  It helps control the behavior and output of AI models by carefully crafting what is asked and how.

## ðŸ§© 2. Types of Prompt Engineering

### ðŸ”¹ a. Zero-shot Prompting
Ask a question without examples.
```text
"Translate this sentence to French: 'How are you?'"
```

### ðŸ”¹ b. One-shot Prompting
Provide a single example.
```text
"English: Hello â†’ French: Bonjour
English: Good night â†’ French:"
```

### ðŸ”¹ c. Few-shot Prompting
Provide multiple examples to establish a pattern.
```text
Q: What's the capital of France? A: Paris
Q: What's the capital of Germany? A: Berlin
Q: What's the capital of Italy? A:
```

### ðŸ”¹ d. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Encourage step-by-step reasoning.
```text
"If a train travels 60 miles in 1 hour and 90 miles in 1.5 hours, what's the average speed? Let's think step by step."
```

### ðŸ”¹ e. Instruction-based Prompting
Use direct instructions to set the tone or format.
```text
"You are an expert tutor. Explain the concept of gravity in simple terms."
```

### ðŸ”¹ f. Roleplay Prompting
Assign roles to guide AI behavior.
```text
"You are a friendly software engineer mentoring a junior developer."
```

### ðŸ”¹ g. ReAct Prompting (Reason + Act)
Used for agent models that both reason and interact with tools.
```text
"Question: What is the capital of Canada?
Thought: I need to look up a list of countries and their capitals.
Action: search[Canada capital]"
```

### ðŸ”¹ h. Multi-turn Prompting
Designing prompts that span multiple back-and-forth exchanges.
```text
User: Tell me about photosynthesis.
Assistant: Photosynthesis is...
User: Explain it like I'm 5.
```

### ðŸ”¹ i. Contextual Prompting
Injecting prior information to guide the model.
```text
"Given that Alice is Bob's sister, who is Bob to Alice?"
```

### ðŸ”¹ j. Contrastive Prompting
Show contrasting examples to clarify the task.
```text
"Good answer: Clear, concise, helpful
Bad answer: Vague, confusing, irrelevant
Now write a good answer for: 'What is AI?'"
```

### ðŸ”¹ k. Iterative Refinement Prompting
Improving outputs by refeeding and refining them.
```text
"Revise this paragraph to make it more persuasive."
```

### ðŸ”¹ l. Self-Consistency Prompting
Asking the model multiple times and aggregating the results.
```text
"Answer this math problem five times and choose the most common answer."
```

### ðŸ”¹ m. Meta Prompting
Ask the model to generate or evaluate prompts.
```text
"Create a prompt that summarizes legal contracts in plain English."
```

### ðŸ”¹ n. Retrieval-Augmented Prompting
Use external knowledge from documents or databases.
```text
"Based on the contents of document A, summarize the benefits of product X."
```

### ðŸ”¹ o. Tree-of-Thought Prompting
Branching reasoning paths to improve decision making.
```text
"Consider three different solutions to this puzzle and compare them."
```
