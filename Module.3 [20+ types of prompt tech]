ðŸ§© 20 Types of Prompt Engineering

1. Zero-shot Prompting
Description: Asking the model to perform a task with no prior examples.

Example:
"Translate the sentence 'Good morning' into French."

2. One-shot Prompting
Description: Providing one example to guide the model.

Example:
"English: Hello â†’ French: Bonjour.
English: Thank you â†’"

3. Few-shot Prompting
Description: Supplying a few examples to set a pattern.

Example:
"Q: 2 + 2 = ? A: 4
Q: 3 + 5 = ? A:"

4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Description: Encouraging the model to reason step by step.

Example:
"Is 945 divisible by 3? Let's think step by step."

5. Instruction-based Prompting
Description: Explicitly instructing the model to perform a task.

Example:
"Explain photosynthesis in simple language suitable for a 6th grader."

6. Roleplay Prompting
Description: Assigning a specific role or persona to the model.

Example:
"Act like a career counselor and suggest jobs for someone interested in art and tech."

7. ReAct Prompting (Reason + Act)
Description: Combine reasoning with actionable commands, often for agents.

Example:
"Thought: I need to look up current stock prices.
Action: search[Apple stock price]"

8. Self-Consistency Prompting
Description: Asking the model multiple times and picking the most consistent or frequent response.

Usage: For more accurate answers in mathematical or reasoning tasks.

9. Contextual Prompting
Description: Including relevant context from earlier parts of a conversation or document.

Example:
"Based on the user's previous purchase history, recommend 3 new books."

10. Contrastive Prompting
Description: Asking the model to compare and contrast.

Example:
"Compare React and Angular in terms of performance, scalability, and learning curve."

11. Multi-turn Prompting
Description: Using dialogue-style back-and-forth interaction to build understanding.

Example:
User: What's a neural network?
Model: It's a system...
User: Can you give a real-world example?"

12. Prompt Chaining
Description: Feeding the output of one prompt into the next.

Example:
Prompt 1: Summarize the article. â†’ Prompt 2: Turn the summary into a tweet.

13. Delimiting Prompting
Description: Using delimiters (like triple quotes or tags) to clearly define the input.

Example:
"Summarize the following text: The sun is the star..."

14. Few-shot CoT Prompting
Description: Combining few-shot examples with reasoning steps.

Example:
Q: If Jack has 5 apples and eats 2, how many remain? A: Let's think step by step...

15. In-Context Learning Prompting
Description: Embedding labeled examples in the prompt to guide generation.

Usage: Classification, sentiment analysis, entity extraction, etc.

16. Scaffolded Prompting
Description: Breaking a complex task into multiple simpler sub-prompts.

Example:

Extract key points.

Generate a summary from key points.

Rephrase summary as a tweet.

17. Persona Prompting
Description: Defining the model's tone, behavior, and personality.

Example:
"You are an optimistic life coach. Always motivate the user with kindness."

18. Critique & Refine Prompting
Description: Asking the model to critique or improve its previous response.

Example:
"Rewrite your last answer to be more concise and persuasive."

19. Embedding-based Prompting
Description: Using vector similarity (retrieved context) to influence prompt design.

Usage: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setups.

20. Format-specific Prompting
Description: Asking for structured output in a specific format (JSON, YAML, CSV).

Example:
"Return the top 5 programming languages in JSON format with name and popularity score."
